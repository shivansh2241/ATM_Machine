# ATM_MachineBiometric ATM Banking System Physical cards can be a convenient way for accessing the money in one's checking and savings accounts. Unfortunately, debit card problems such as stolen cards or PINs, over drafted accounts, or fraudulent charges are also common. Some of these problems can be prevented by keeping careful track of one's debit card as well as the amount of money that is currently in the account. Lost or stolen debit cards are some of the most common debit card problems. Of course, keeping track of one's card and wallet is one way to prevent a lost debit card, but that doesn't prevent the number being stolen after the card was used. As a general rule, it is a good idea not to use a debit card online, but use a credit card instead. This is because it is a simpler process to get fraudulent charges removed from a credit card than to replace money that was stolen from a checking account.
